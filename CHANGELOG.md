# @narumitw/pi-usage

## 0.59.0

### Minor Changes

- ed425e0: Add MiniMax Global and China Token Plan quota and pay-as-you-go balance reporting with deterministic credential routing.
- db89cb1: Add Vercel AI Gateway credit reporting with exact remaining balance and lifetime spend from the official credits endpoint.
- 6a23d01: Add Moonshot AI Global and China API balance reporting with region-bound credentials, shared environment-key safeguards, and native USD or CNY semantics.
- 0400845: Add trailing 30-day Baseten organization Model APIs spend reporting with credits and net subtotal.

### Patch Changes

- c3947f7: Prevent Codex reset countdown timers from crashing Pi when their captured extension context becomes stale during session replacement.

## 0.58.0

### Minor Changes

- 42d650a: Add Fireworks rated API spend reporting for the official fireworks provider, summarizing the trailing 30 days of rated costs per currency with serverless, dedicated-deployment, and training subtotals from the documented billing summary endpoint.
  
  The account slug is discovered through the documented account listing when exactly one account is visible; keys that can see several accounts set `fireworksAccountId` in `pi-usage.json`. Fireworks exposes no credit-balance or spend-cap endpoint, so the report claims only rated spend.
